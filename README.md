## :page_facing_up: About

I've made this project to learn how to deal with NextJS, the new Image component of the v10 and the most interesting thing, in my opinion, SSG. Static site generators (SSG) apply data and content to templates, and generate a view of a page which can be served to the visitors of a site.

The greatest difference between a static site generator and a traditional web application stack, is that instead of waiting until a page is requested and then generating its view on demand each time, a static site generator does this in advance so that the view is ready to serve ahead of time. And it does so for every possible view of a site at build time.

In this project you can create your own Github Profile Page with the main informations and share it with your friends or put it on your resumÃ¨.

Read more about SSG in: [What is a Static Site Generator? And 3 ways to find the best one](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/).
